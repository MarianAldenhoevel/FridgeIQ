# What is FridgeIQ?
FridgeIQ is a dissection-puzzle consisting of 16 magnetic parts that can be assembled on a surface like a fridge door.

The set comes with a number of challenges to arrange the parts in squares, rectangles and triangles of various sizes.

And there are user-generated extra challenges.

# What is this?
This repository contains code produced while playing with the parts and challenges and thinking about it.
